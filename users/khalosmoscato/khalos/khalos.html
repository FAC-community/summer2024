        <h1>Khalos Calogero Filho Moscato</h1>
        <p id="basic-info">Welcome to my bio page! I am a Khalos, Italian Brazilian guy living in London with a passion for tech. My name "Calogero" comes from 2 greek words: "kalós" and "gerus", reason why I have always been called "Khalos" by my family and friends. Kalós in greek means beauty or good, and gerus means old age. This is a paradox considering I am nenither beautiful and good, nor of old age (yet). I would rather describe myself as extremely attractive (very kalós), relatively good (almost kalós), still young (νέος), but my name would become too complicated.</p>
