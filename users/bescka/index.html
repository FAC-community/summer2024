Single Page Applications
------------------------ 

After a kind review by Maxitect, these updates are centered around navigation! 

The concept workflow for this site was originally to write in either
vimwiki script or markdown, then export these directly to a local version 
of the codebase using a custom HTML template. 

To make these exports a bit more modular, the pages have been refactored to 
just include the html associated with their content. This can then be 
dynamically loaded into the main page which contains the header/ footer/ navbar
etc. 

Patch updates: 
* Header links back to home
* Dynamic menu dropdown loads core pages
* External links are distinguished by their path and opened in a new tab
* Event listeners wait for DOM to load in order to identify content links
* MathJax integration fixed for rendering LaTeX in dynamically loaded content 
* Started the devBlog! Some explanatory notes and references added to codebase

On modularization, effectively this makes it a Single Page Application. 
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/SPA#

There are other ways of doing this - namely putting html flags to insert content
on the server side before the page loads, called SSI (Server Side Includes). You 
can just include a flag in the base html template like this
<\!--#include virtual="/path/to/file" --\> (remove \, used as an escape character)
and at the top of the content you want to use. 

This is effectively javascript emulation of SSI but is done client side. 
The pros of this architecture aside from modularization seem to be 
snappy load times primarily, but apparently SEO can suffer (not an issue here!)

          <!-- Explanation: "#" are placeholder links. Here, as we are actually
                not going anywhere, just loading html into the same page, the 
                "#" allows us to trigger javascript actions without anything 
                happening!
            
                You can see in script.js that it is an event listener on click 
                of the respective ids that triggers the content load, where
                we overwrite the "default" behaviour -->
