<h2>Git out of here! What does "Git" stand for?</h2>

<p>Git was created by Linus Torvolds in 2005. But why "Git"?</p> 

<p>Well, it turns out that Linus explained this in the initial 
readme to the Git repository!</p>

<pre>
<code class="general-code-block">GIT - the stupid content tracker

"git" can mean anything, depending on your mood.

 - random three-letter combination that is pronounceable, and not
   actually used by any common UNIX command.  The fact that it is a
   mispronounciation of "get" may or may not be relevant.
 - stupid. contemptible and despicable. simple. Take your pick from the
   dictionary of slang.
 - "global information tracker": you're in a good mood, and it actually
   works for you. Angels sing, and a light suddenly fills the room. 
 - "goddamn idiotic truckload of sh*t": when it breaks

This is a stupid (but extremely fast) directory content manager.  It
doesn't do a whole lot, but what it _does_ do is track directory
contents efficiently.

<p>
To see this we can simply clone the repo and checkout the initial 
commit:  
</p>
<code class="general-code-block">git clone https://github.com/git/git.git</code>
<p>You can see the initial commit id with </p>

<code class="general-code-block">git log -reverse</code>

<p>And checkout with the id: </p>
<code class="general-code-block">git checkout e83c5163316f89bfbde7d9ab23ca2e25604af290
</code>

of the initial architecture of git. For example this project
