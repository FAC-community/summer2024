<p>TLDR: 
    <ul> 
        <li> Learning is often a process of iterative failure (and hopefully improvement!). Here is an example!</li>
        <li> Pseudocode can be a good way to get your thoughts down for tricky problems.</li>
        <li> Timing how long execution takes can be done with <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/console/time_static">‘console.time(’label’)’ and ‘console.timeEnd(’label’)’</a>.</li>

<p>I recently came across the CodeWars problem <a
href="https://www.codewars.com/kata/5a3af5b1ee1aaeabfe000084/train/javascript">"Sums of Perfect Squares"</a>. The task is to create a fast algorithm to work out the lowest number of squared numbers which add together to make the given number. 
</p>
<p>
There is a mini-log of problems and reviews of upvoted submissions to CodeWars appended to the site. As a harder problem, it might be illuminating to explicitly show the process of getting stuck on a problem and iteratively failing. It is a great way to learn and it would be nice to hear any ideas on the problem or the approach! 
</p>
<h2>The Problem</h2>
<pre><code class="general-code-block">The task is simply stated. Given an integer n (3 &lt; n &lt; 109), find the length of the smallest list of perfect squares which add up to n. Come up with the best algorithm you can; you&#39;ll need it!

Examples:

    sum_of_squares(17) = 2
    17 = 16 + 1 (16 and 1 are perfect squares).
    sum_of_squares(15) = 4
    15 = 9 + 4 + 1 + 1. There is no way to represent 15 as the sum of three perfect squares.
    sum_of_squares(16) = 1
    16 itself is a perfect square.

Time constraints:

5 easy (sample) test cases: n &lt; 20

5 harder test cases: 1000 &lt; n &lt; 15000

5 maximally hard test cases: 5e8 &lt; n &lt; 1e9

100 random maximally hard test cases: 1e8 &lt; n &lt; 1e9</code></pre>
<h2 id="first-attempt-just-plain-wrong">First Attempt: Just Plain
Wrong</h2>
<p>The idea here was quite simple. Here is the pseudo code:</p>
<pre><code class="general-code-block">function sumOfSquares_v1(n) {
    get the sqrt of n 
    
    repeat: 
        take the integer value of the sqrt
            square it
        subtract the squared number from n
        repeat until n = 0
    
    return the count of times this process was executed
}</code></pre>
<p>And the javascript implementation:</p>
<pre><code class="general-code-block">function sumOfSquares_v1(n) {
    let x = n;
    let count = 0;
   while (x &gt; 0) {
        let y = Math.floor(Math.sqrt(x));
        let y_ps = Math.pow(y,2); 
        x = x - y_ps; 
        count += 1; 
    }
    return count;
}</code></pre>
<p>This got through most of the basic tests! The problem is that if you
have a number such as 18, the solution does not feature the highest
square - instead the smallest sum of perfect squares is 9 + 9, or a
count of 2. This algorithm would give instead 16 + 1 + 1, or a count of
3.</p>
<h2 id="second-attempt-too-slow">Second Attempt: Too Slow</h2>
<p>The second attempt tried to brute force the solution - by iterating
through the possible combinations of squares and returning the smallest
number of combinations.</p>
<p>Squares get pretty big pretty quickly. So maybe we can save some
compute time by precalculating some squares based on the value of
n. </p>
<p>We can also save some time because we can stop iterating if the count
is 1 or 2. This is because we start with the highest square, so if it
isn’t that, then 2 will be correct.</p>
<pre><code class="general-code-block">function sumOfSquares(n) {
    initialise an array of possible squares: 
        sqrt n as before, then create an array of squares from the integer of the sqrt to 1 (so the array is in reverse order)
    
    repeat (similar to v1, but faster because the squares have been precomputed): 
        Round 1
        Start with the highest square lower than or equal to n 
            Take that away from n
        Find the highest square lower than or equal to the remainder
            Take that away from n
        Log the count in an array
        
        Round 2 - 
        Now take the next square that is lower than or equal to n
            Follow the same process as in Round 1
    
    return the minimum count logged in the array - break if returns 1 or 2

<p>Here is the javascript implementation:</p>
<pre><code class="general-code-block">function sumOfSquares(n) { 
   
   function initializeSqArray(n){
        let sq_array = []
        const y = Math.floor(Math.sqrt(n));

            sq_array.push(i**2)
        }
        return sq_array
   };

    function getMaxSquarePosition(n) {
        for (let i = 0; i &lt; sq_array.length; i++){
            if (sq_array[i] &lt;= n) {
                return i

        let count = 0; 
        let x = n

<p>This actually passed the base tests where n&lt;20, the bigger tests where 1000&lt;n&lt15000 and some maximally hard tests where 5e8&lt;n&lt;1e9 (500 million to 1 billion)! But it was too slow for all of the maximally hard tests. We might need to scrap the
whole thing and try another approach. One thing we can do before that is check
where the time is being spent. We can do this by logging the time to the
console with ‘console.time(’label’)’ and ‘console.endTime(’label’)’.</p>
<pre><code class="general-code-block">// .........

<p>Running a test with 661915703, we can see that the initialization of
the array of squares only took 1.187ms - Thats pretty good! The error
message in CodeWars informs us that we have 12000ms, or 12 seconds to
complete the run with all the examples. So it seems that this might be
an OK idea. So the problem is then iterating through the possible
squares. This part took 2.897s. So it can solve a few
maximally hard cases, but there is no way it will get through 100 in 12
seconds!</p>
<h2 id="next-steps">What Next?</h2>
<p>Next step: can we be a bit more discerning with the order of our
checks? What is most 'likely' to be the solution?</p>
