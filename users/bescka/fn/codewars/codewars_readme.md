This is a mini-log of codewars challenge attempts, upvoted answers and some testing. 

## Running tests locally: 

Note do do this you need to have nodejs installed on your machine. This is 
the standard way to run javascript in your code editor as opposed to a browser: 
https://nodejs.org/en

To run: 

* navigate to this directory and type "npm install" in the command line to get 
* chai/mocha and their dependencies which have been defined in the 
* package-lock.json file (mocha is the testing module, chai provides 
* assertion functionality) 

* Selected tests by kyu are included in the test/ dir. 
* There are a few ways you can configure calling them, but you can run the test file
  with e.g. "npx mocha test/test_8.mjs"
