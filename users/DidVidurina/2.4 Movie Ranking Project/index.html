<h3>A hero of our time by Mikhail Lermontov</h3>
<h4>A masterpiece about a Russian man of noble descent who had set out to travel the Caucasus during the Russo-Turkic wars.</h4>

<p>Due to his strange nature and lack of regard for the material, the contemporaries he is surrounded with struggle to comprehend him, which leads to extremely interesting and realistic interactions.<br/>
His sole quest on this world is to experience raw adventure, and feel the thrills and cultures which many a noblemen may have seen as below himself, as a result his behaviour is comprehended as idealistic,<br/>
whereas in reality it is similar to an addict looking for his next fix, and we find ourself reading a diary of a man who is unable to fill the hole in his heart, which we can all relate to.</p>
