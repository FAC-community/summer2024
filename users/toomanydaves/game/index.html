            <p>
                I'd like to explore different ideas for games and to invite anyone to collaborate if something strikes a chord. My plan is to use this page to brainstorm and keep a list of possibilities. Should something spark your interest, please leave a comment on Github or reach out over Discord.

                    <h2>Pong</h2>
                    <p>
                        To get the ball rolling, I'm thinking about simply following <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games/Tutorials/2D_Breakout_game_pure_JavaScript" target="_blank">this tutorial at MDN</a> for creating a basic 2D pong-style game using the canvas element. Hopefully as I complete the steps, inspiration will come about ways to customize it to make it special and unique.

                    <p>
                        I've now completed the tutorial. Here is the current status of <a href="pong/index.html">the game</a>.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2>CSS Selectors</h2>
                    <p>
                        I was imagining a game that's designed to help people practice their skills writing CSS selectors. For each exercise they'd be shown a written chunk of HTML with a particular portion(s) highlighted. Their task would be to write a selector that only targets those elements.

                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2>Wordle</h2>
                    <p>
                        <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html" target="_blank">Wordle</a> is a popular game from the NY Times where players have 6 attempts to guess a five-letter word, with feedback given for each guess in the form of colored tiles indicating when letters match or occupy the correct position. The game mechanics are very simple, and I think it would be a useful exercise to try to implement the game oneself, and then to use it as a jumping off point for further work.
