# Project Website.
Hello! Iâ€™m Danielle, and this is my website project created for Founders and Coders (FAC). My aim was to create a responsive website with a light and dark theme option, applied via a toggle switch.

### Built with:
- HTML
- CSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Javascript


**Light & Dark theme:**

For my website, my main focus was to have both a light and dark theme, activated by a toggle switch. When clicking the toggle switch:

- Colours change from a bright colour palette to a dark colour palette.
- Pictures and graphics in each section switch to their dark theme equivalents.

In creating a light and dark theme, my main source of reference was [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_toggle_dark_mode.asp), where I learned hot to combine CSS and Javascript to achieve this. The logic for the function to toggle between light and dark was then adapted and used to switch between the different images and icons for each theme. 

**Responsiveness:** 

To make my website responsive, I used a combination of CSS Grid and Flexbox. Grid was used to set up the main structure / layout of the website. Flexbox was then used within grid items to have better control over issues faced with alignment of the divs and div items.This was especially useful when viewing with mobile dimensions.I used media queries to achieve this. 

- On a mobile device, the navigation bar is set to be [fixed](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_navbar_horizontal.asp) at the top of the screen, ensuring it remains accessible. Using Flexbox, helped to align it horizontally.
