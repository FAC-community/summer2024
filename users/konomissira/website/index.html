                <h2>About Me:</h2>
                <p>Hello! My background spans various roles including warehousing, commis waiter, supermarket assistant, bartender, and fire alarm technician, where I specialized in the maintenance and installation of fire alarm systems. I began my coding journey on Udemy and actively contributed to my community by assisting at a food bank in East London during the COVID-19 pandemic. Since childhood, I’ve had a strong desire to work in the field of computer science. Due to family circumstances, I started working right after high school, but I pursued my passion by earning a degree in Computer Science. Through meetups, I’ve collaborated with others applicants and learned valuable skills from Founders & Coders volunteers, including GitHub scripts such as git pull and cloning repositories.</p>
