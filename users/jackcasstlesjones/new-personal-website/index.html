              In 2021, I made the crazy choice of moving to Thailand with my
              girlfriend mid-COVID to teach English in public schools in
              Bangkok. In my teaching schedule, there were several hours of
              every day where I had to be in school but had no marking or
              teaching to do. Having messed around with FreeCodeCamp before, I
              got stuck into some Udemy tutorials and the rest is history! 3
              years of on-and-off learning followed, and last August I switched
              to using The Odin Project as my main learning resource. Since
              then, I have been able to build some of my passion projects that I
              conceived while barely able to style a static webpage. So far,
              learning to code has been an intensely challenging but amazingly
              rewarding experience.

 Over the past couple of months the
              Tuesday night FAC meetups have been a way to feel a strong sense
              of purpose in my work again. So far, FAC has been a fantastic
              introduction to collaborative working via GitHub, and I can't wait
              to continue working on projects with the friends that I have made
              here. I am also on the waiting list for an ADHD assessment. The
              realisation that I could have ADHD has changed my life far more
              than I would have expected. My understanding of myself and my
              behaviours has changed dramatically, and my ability to communicate
              with my partner has improved hugely.

            <p class="about-card-info">
              I am hoping to join the FAC bootcamp and work towards pursuing a
              career as a web developer and designer. This is a scary step but I
              am ready to take the plunge. I believe FAC is a fantastic
              environment for me due to the peer led learning style and open and
              wholesome atmosphere. I am excited to learn from those around me
              as well as helping out anyone in need as we all work towards a
              common goal. When I look back to October 2021, I would have had no
              idea that I would have stuck with self-teaching coding for this
              long and been able to build some of the things that I have. I am
              so excited by the idea of joining a more structured course with
              teachers and peers who can help me on this journey.

              I designed Olympiatree as an educational resource, the likes of
              which I would be amazed to find in a museum, especially with a
              touch screen. I wanted the user to have an immersive way to
              navigate around the family tree. After realising that this
              couldn't be done with traditional scrolling, I realised that I
              waned a 'Google Maps'-esque way of moving around: a 'floaty'
              feeling with momentum and zooming. This led me to utilise Anvaka's
              Panzoom framework. I used a grid layout with custom CSS to build
              the tree, and used Figma to design the individual cards for the
              Gods. Finally, I wanted to insert atmospheric music (again, the
              kind I hope would accompany the museum exhibit) to draw the user
              into the ethereal nature of the subject matter even more.

              This was a very early project I made after taking Jonas Schmedtmann's first course. I wanted to use the design and development principles I had learnt to build something of my own. I contacted a friend who ran a small bakery business in lockdown, and she agreed to let me design her a website. After learning crude CCS, it was great to utilise responsive design principles, as well as accessibility principles, to make a website with a cohesive design scheme.
              I gave the website a fun and delicate feel, reflecting the nature of the business and the products that my friend was creating. After following tutorials for such a long time, this was my first foray into making my CSS work together to produce something that looked aesthetically pleasing and thematically coordinated.

              A game that I used to play with my other food-obsessed friends to
              pass the time. The IRL game consists of naming foods and
              discussing whether they are Humble or Noble. That's it. That's the
              game. Some easy examples include onions (humble) vs sushi (noble).
              The excitement comes in the grey areas. What about the full
              English? Tacos? Are button mushrooms humble while portobello are
              noble? I invite you to jump on and find out. There is no right
              answer, and no way of keeping score. This project also utilised
              API calls to the Unsplash API to (sometimes) find a matching
              picture for each food, and I had to pass the rigorous criteria of
              crediting the creator of each image in order to successfully apply
              for the application to utilise Unsplash's Production request rate
              limit.
