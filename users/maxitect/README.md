# My Website Read Me
I'm Max and this is my website. This website is responsive using CSS Flexbox. The game I have here was created following an mdn web docs tutorial, linked below.

## Flexbox
A nice source to learn more about flexbox: https://flexboxfroggy.com/

Some properties that are helpful:
- justify-content: This CSS property aligns items horizontally.
- align-items: This CSS property aligns items vertically.

These properties accept the following values:
- flex-start: Items align to the left side of the container.
- flex-end: Items align to the right side of the container.
- center: Items align at the center of the container.
- space-between: Items display with equal spacing between them.
- space-around: Items display with equal spacing around them.

## Game: The Journey of the Blockbuster
This game was created following most of this tutorial: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games/Tutorials/2D_Breakout_game_pure_JavaScript/Create_the_Canvas_and_draw_on_it
Based on the above, a lot has been modified and stylised to fit my preferences and so the game is unique.
