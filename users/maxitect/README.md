# My Website Read Me
I'm Max and this is my website. I'm trying to create something dynamic using the flexbox functionality.

## Flexbox
A nice source to learn more about flexbox: https://flexboxfroggy.com/

Some properties that are helpful:
- justify-content: This CSS property aligns items horizontally.
- align-items: This CSS property aligns items vertically.

These properties accept the following values:
- flex-start: Items align to the left side of the container.
- flex-end: Items align to the right side of the container.
- center: Items align at the center of the container.
- space-between: Items display with equal spacing between them.
- space-around: Items display with equal spacing around them.
