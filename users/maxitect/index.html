        <h1>Max's Flexy Flex Webbox</h1>
        <p class="central">Hi! I made this website to introduce myself to the FAC community and hopefully <b>flex</b> my skills a lil' bit.</p>
        <div class="flex-container">
            <div class="flex-item">
                <h2>About me</h2>
                <p>Hi! I'm Max, I'm an architect and computational designer currently working in the AEC* industry. I have a background in programming in Python, C# and data analytics but very little web development experience.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="flex-item">
                <h2>My experience</h2>
                <p>My specialism is computational design. Computational design uses a rules-based approach and algorithmic design to solve building engineering design problems. This can take the form of designing automated design workflows for multiple projects or parametric workflows to model and resolve designs involving complex geometries. I have worked alongside front end, back end and data engineers to deliver bespoke apps and workflows for clients in the AEC* industry.</p>

            <div class="flex-item">
                <h2>What I've learned so far</h2>
                <li>How to make a responsive website in HTML, using CSS Flexbox, it is this website, hello!</li>
                <li>How to write programs in Javascript through kata training on Codewars, using my understanding of Python and C# programming to translate what can be done in those languages into Javascript functions and methods.</li>
                <li>How to create a simple game using vanilla HTML, CSS and Javascript (link to game under <b>Projects</b>)</li>
            </div>
            <div class="flex-item">
                <h2>My next steps</h2>
                <p>I have now learned to make a responsive webpage in HTML/CSS and interactive content to create a game using Javascript. I am beginning to understand how these can be built to suit a bespoke solution for myself. My next step will be to build a simple game that is almost entirely my creation.</p>
