        <h1>Max's Flexy Flex Website</h1>
        <p class="central">Hi! I made this little website to introduce myself to the FAC community and hopefully <b>flex</b> my skills a little bit.</p>
        <div class="flex-container">
            <div class="flex-item">
                <h2>About me</h2>
                <p>Hi! I'm Max, I'm an architect and computational designer currently working in the AEC* industry. I have a background in programming in Python, C# and data analytics but very little web development experience.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="flex-item">
                <h2>My experience</h2>
                <p>My specialism is computational design. Computational design uses a rules-based approach and algorithmic design to solve building engineering design problems. This can take the form of designing automated design workflows for multiple projects or parametric workflows to model and resolve designs involving complex geometries. I have worked alongside front end, back end and data engineers to deliver bespoke apps and workflows for clients in the AEC* industry.</p>

                <h2>What I've learned so far</h2>
                <p>I've learned how to make a website in HTML and how to write programs in Javascript. While I have quite a lot of experience programming algorithms in Python and C#, Javascript and HTML are relatively new to me.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="flex-item">
                <h2>My next steps</h2>
                <p>While I have learned programming in Javascript, I am still unsure how to implement Javascript to make an interactive webpage and be used for web development. This is what I want to explore and perhaps bring more of this into my game.</p>
